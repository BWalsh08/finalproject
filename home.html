				On 23 June 2023, the Wizards traded Porziņģis to the Boston Celtics as part of a three-team deal that sent Marcus Smart to the Memphis Grizzlies and Tyus Jones to Washington. Boston also received a 2023 first-round pick (pick No. 25) and a top-four-protected 2024 first-round pick (via Golden State Warriors) from the Grizzlies while Washington acquired Danilo Gallinari, Mike Muscala, and Boston's 2023 second-round pick (pick No. 35). Porziņģis chose to wear number 8 with the Celtics as his usual number 6 was retired for Bill Russell. Porziņģis made his Celtics debut on 25 October 2023 in a return to Madison Square Garden against the New York Knicks, propelling Boston to a 108 to 104 season-opening victory as he recorded 30 points, eight rebounds and four blocks, including 15 points in the first quarter alone. His 30 points set the record for the most points scored in a debut in Celtics history. On December 28, Porzingis scored a season-high 35 points and grabbed eight rebounds in a 128 to 122 overtime win over the Detroit Pistons.
