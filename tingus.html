				In the Knicks' season opener, on 19 October 2017, Porzingis had 31 points and 12 rebounds in a 105 to 84 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder. On 30 October 2017, he scored a then career-high 38 points in a 116 to 110 win over the Denver Nuggets. Less than a week later, on 5 November, Porzingis set a then career-high with 40 points in a 108 to 101 win over the Indiana Pacers. He was subsequently named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for games played from Monday, 30 October through Sunday, 5 November. Porzingis recorded the best start to a season for Knicks player, earning 300 points through 10 games, two more than Bernard King had to open the 1984/85 season, and his performances continued, where, on 23 January 2018, he was named an Eastern Conference All-Star reserve. However, on 6 February 2018, in a 103 to 89 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks, Porzingis tore his left ACL. He was subsequently ruled out for the rest of the season.

				After his stints with the Knicks and Mavs, Kristaps had a short first season with the Washington Wizards. The following season, on 12 November 2022, Porzingis recorded a double-double with 31 points and 10 rebounds in a 121 to 112 win over the Utah Jazz. On 28 November, he scored a then career-high 41 points in a 142 to 127 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves. In the next game, Porzingis recorded 27 points and a career-high 19 rebounds in an 113 to 107 loss to the Brooklyn Nets. On January 2, 2023, he was named the NBA Eastern Conference Player of the Week for Week 11 (December 26 to January 1), his third career NBA Player of the Week award and first with the Wizards. Porzingis helped lead the Wizards to an undefeated 4 and 0 week with averages of 24.5 points, 8.5 rebounds and 2.5 blocks. On 8 March 2023, he scored a career-high 43 points on 17-of-22 shooting from the field and 7-of-10 shooting from three-point range along with five rebounds and five assists in a 122 to 120 loss to the Atlanta Hawks. Despite averaging a career-high 23.2 points per game on a career-high 49.8% field goal shooting percentage, the Wizards once again missed the play-in tournament, finishing with a 35 and 47 record for the second straight year.

				On 23 June 2023, the Wizards traded Porzingis to the Boston Celtics as part of a three-team deal that sent Marcus Smart to the Memphis Grizzlies and Tyus Jones to Washington. Boston also received a 2023 first-round pick (pick No. 25) and a top-four-protected 2024 first-round pick (via Golden State Warriors) from the Grizzlies while Washington acquired Danilo Gallinari, Mike Muscala, and Boston's 2023 second-round pick (pick No. 35). Porzingis chose to wear number 8 with the Celtics as his usual number 6 was retired for Bill Russell. Porzingis made his Celtics debut on 25 October 2023 in a return to Madison Square Garden against the New York Knicks, propelling Boston to a 108 to 104 season-opening victory as he recorded 30 points, eight rebounds and four blocks, including 15 points in the first quarter alone. His 30 points set the record for the most points scored in a debut in Celtics history. On December 28, Porzingis scored a season-high 35 points and grabbed eight rebounds in a 128 to 122 overtime win over the Detroit Pistons.
